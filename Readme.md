# norlinga's NVIM config

Based on the video series by typecraft.
Check out into ~/.config/nvim

```shell
git clone git<wherever>.git/norlinga/norlinga-nvim ~/.config/nvim
```

A few aliases have been convenient, like `alias nv='nvim'`.

## Adding LSPs and Linters

Remember to install linters and LSPs using `:Mason` if not installed automatically.
